# Pentesting Tools
In this repository, you will find a collection of self-made modules, projects 
and all sorts of things for network pentesting.

## Side notes
As those projects are only for educational purposes, I did not try to optimise them.
I rather focus on explaining how it works, (often) using the simplest code I can write.

I use libraries a lot, may they not be required. I prefer to explain simply using big libraries rather than writing
my own, complicated code no-one (even me) will ever want to read again.
